# cooperativeevasionstrats
The project presents a cooperative defensive guidance law for two-on-two engagement. Instead of classical strategies
in which evasive maneuvers are performed or additional agents (e.g., defender missiles) are deployed, the target pair
lures the pursuing missiles into collision. The optimal cooperative strategy is solved using state-dependent Riccati
equation method. Linearized kinematics and arbitrary-order linear adversariesâ€™ dynamics are assumed in the
guidance law derivation. Imperfect information is assumed on the relative states and the guidance laws employed by
the missile pair. Guidance strategies that the pursuing missiles may employ are assumed to belong to a finite set of
linear guidance laws.
